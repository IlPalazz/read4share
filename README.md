## Intro

The goal of this project is to create an online platform that allows general users (especially students) to share new and second-hand books, either in free form or asking an amount of money.

This platform doesn't aim to handle an eventual payment for the books exchange, but it will permit sellers and buyers to keep in touch each other through an online chat system.

### Example of operation

- A user (the *seller*) wants to sell a book that he owns; the web app will allow him to create a new advertisement and to insert all the book's info (title, authors, ISBN, etc...).
-  Another user (the *buyer*) has seen a book advertisement and he would like to buy it; the web platform will allow him to contact the buyer through a chat panel.

### Build instructions

1. Clone the repository with either [HTTPS](https://gitlab.com/IlPalazz/read4share.git) or [SSH](git@gitlab.com:IlPalazz/read4share.git)
2. Open the terminal and navigate to the project directory (or open it with an IDE)
3. Run the `./gradlew build` command inside the "read4share" folder to build the backend project
3. Run the `ngÂ serve` command inside the "read4share-frontend" folder to build the frontend project

## Backlog

### Types of users

- `viewer` - unregistered / unlogged user
