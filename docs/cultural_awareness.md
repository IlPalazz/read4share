# Cultural awareness

[TOC]

## What is culture

Culture is a term that refers to a large and diverse amount of social aspects and it is not easy to give a precise definition of it. We can think about it as a set of values, beliefs, systems of language, communication, and practices that people share in common and that can be used to define them as a collective. Culture also includes both the material objects that are common to that group and the non-material aspects (knowledge, common sense, assumptions, and expectations). It is also the rules, norms, laws, and morals that govern society; the words and the symbols we use to express meaning, ideas, and concepts (like traffic signs and emojis, for example).

## Cultural differences

Despite the phenomena of information technology proliferation, cultural differences are still significant today and diversity has tended to increase. Cross-cultural communication requires being aware of cultural differences because what may be considered perfectly acceptable and natural in one country, can be confusing or even offensive in another. When facing cultural differences I would keep in mind:

- **body language**: given that the number of totally universal human gestures is very few, there is a concrete possibility to be misinterpreted or even found offensive (e.g. pointing at people, holding up various fingers to illustrate numbers).
- **dress**: this could be a matter of avoiding even brief and accidental showing of parts of the body or could be more a case of certain clothes being taken as tacky or unprofessional (especially inside the university).
- **questions**: in some cultures it is normal to say "Yes, I understand" to any instructions from the boss/teacher, even if they did not.
- **food and drink**: when you travel abroad, you should keep in mind that hardly you are going to find the same food that you were used to eat in your home country. The secret is to adapt you habits and be open minded.
- **interrupting**: in some cultures several people almost talking over each other is normal, whereas in others people will wait until there is complete silence before making their contribution.

## Hofstede's cultural dimensions theory

- It is a **framework** for cross-cultural communication.
- It shows the effects of a society's **culture** on the **values** of its members and how these values relate to **behavior**.
- It is based on a big survey executed between 1967 and 1973 regarding national values differences across worldwide IBM's employees.
- The analysis identified differences on six *cultural dimensions* indexes:
  1. **Power distance**: the extent to which the less powerful members of organizations and institutions (like the family) accept and expect that power is distributed unequally. A higher degree of the Index indicates that hierarchy is clearly established and executed in society, without doubt or reason. A lower degree of the Index signifies that people question authority and attempt to distribute power.
  2. **Individualism vs. collectivism**: the degree to which people in a society are integrated into groups. In the collectivist society, the personal relationship prevails over the task and should be established first, whereas in the individualist society, the task is supposed to prevail over any personal relationships.
  3. **Uncertainty avoidance**: the extent to which people in a culture feel threatened by uncertain or unknown situations. Societies that score a high degree opt for stiff codes of behavior, guidelines, laws, and generally rely on absolute truth. A lower degree shows more acceptance of differing thoughts or ideas, society tends to impose fewer regulations, ambiguity is more accustomed to, and the environment is more free-flowing.
  4. **Masculinity vs. femininity**: masculinity is defined as a preference in society for achievement, heroism, assertiveness and material rewards for success. Women in the respective societies tend to display different values. In feminine societies, they share modest and caring views equally with men. In more masculine societies, women are somewhat assertive and competitive, but notably less than men. In other words, they still recognize a gap between male and female values.
  5. **Long-term vs. short-term orientation**: associates the connection of the past with the current and future actions/challenges. A lower degree of this index (*short-term*) indicates that traditions are honored and kept, while steadfastness is valued. Societies with a high degree in this index (*long-term*) view adaptation and circumstantial, pragmatic problem-solving as a necessity. A poor country that is short-term oriented usually has little to no economic development, while long-term oriented countries continue to develop to a level of prosperity.
  6. **Indulgence vs. restraint**: Indulgence is defined as "a society that allows relatively free gratification of basic and natural human desires related to enjoying life and having fun". Its counterpart is defined as "a society that controls gratification of needs and regulates it by means of strict social norms". This dimension refers to the degree of freedom that societal norms give to citizens in fulfilling their human desires.

## How to cluster cultures

### What is a cluster

A cluster is a set of cultures group together in order to provide a convenient way to:

- analyze similarities and differences among cultural groups
- make meaningful generalization about culture and leadership

### Characteristics of clusters

Based on the geographical area, we can distinguish:

- **Anglo** - competitive and result-oriented
- **Confucian Asia** - result-driven, encourage group working together over individual goals
- **Eastern Europe** - forceful, supportive of co-workers, treat women with equality
- **Germanic Europe** - value competition & aggressiveness and are more result-oriented
- **Latin America** - loyal & devoted to their families and similar groups
- **Latin Europe** - value individual autonomy
- **Middle East** - devoted & loyal to their own people, women afforded less status
- **Nordic Europe** - high priority on long-term success, women treated with greater equality
- **Southern Asia** - strong family & deep concern for their communities
- **Sub-Sahara Africa** - concerned & sensitive to others, demonstrate strong family loyalty

### The Lewis model

- Tripartite model:
  1. **Linear-Active**: the English-speaking world – North America, Britain, Australia and New Zealand, and Northern Europe, including Scandinavia and Germanic countries.
  2. **Reactive**: all major countries in Asia, except the Indian sub-continent, which is hybrid.
  3. **Multi-Active**: Southern Europe, Mediterranean countries, South America, sub-Saharan Africa, Arab and other cultures in the Middle East, India and Pakistan and most of the Slavs.

|      LINEAR-ACTIVE       |        MULTI-ACTIVE         |          REACTIVE           |
| :----------------------: | :-------------------------: | :-------------------------: |
|   Talks half the time    |   Talks most of the time    |  Listens most of the time   |

| Plans ahead step by step |  Plans grand outline pnly   | Looks at general principles |
|    Polite but direct     |          Emotional          |      Polite, indirect       |
|   Confronts with logic   |    Confronts emotionally    |       Never confronts       |
|    Rarely interrupts     |      Often interrupts       |      Doesn't interrupt      |
|   Sometimes impatient    |          Impatient          |           Patient           |
|  Limited body language   |   Unlimited body language   |    Subtle body language     |

## Personal experience

During my Erasmus period in the Netherlands, I met a lot of people from different cultures and sometimes things didn't go as I expected. In particular, I remember a couple of relevant episodes: 

1. It was the first day of my exchange period and I was moving to my new apartment. In that occasion I met one of my neighbors, a Portuguese guy. During the conversation, I unintentionally formed a strange sign with my hand and he told me that in his culture it was a "bad sign". That time I first realized that I should have been more aware of differences and try to be open minded with others.
2. Lots of times, especially at the beginning, I felt culture shock inside supermarkets and other shops due to my conviction of finding the same products that I used to use in Italy. I found myself trying to explain to clerks what type of item I needed but sometimes they did not understand what I was talking about.

## My culture

I am from Italy, so I can try to write down some general points regarding the Italian culture:

- During conversations we stand much closer to one another, and we usually gesticulate quite often. Once a relationship develops, air-kissing on both cheeks, starting with the left is often added as well as a pat on the back between men.
- The family is the center of the social structure and provides a stabilizing influence for its members. In the north, generally only the nuclear family lives together; while in the south, the extended family often resides together in one house.
- The concept of good image is important to Italians: the way you dress can indicate your social status, your family's background, and your education level.
- Punctuality is not mandatory. You may arrive between 15 minutes late if invited to dinner and up to 30 minutes late if invited to a party.
- Despite the presence of the Pope, a lot of Italians have little or no involvement with the church. Constitutionally, Italy has no state religion, in practice though, the state religion is Roman Catholicism.
- Italy is a sheer paradise for art lovers. Italian art has influenced several major artistic movements and has given birth to the most notable painters and sculptors. Italy is home to some of the most famous art galleries, museums, and exhibitions.

## Communicate with other cultures

If I would need to communicate with other cultures in the future I will definitely follow the following tips:

- *Learn about other cultures* because I think that researching someone’s cultural background shows that you are interested in them and it's considered extremely polite.
- *Memorize common phrases in other languages* is an easy way to show others you are willing to meet them halfway.
- *Be open-minded* and don't think that there is always one right way of doing things and that everything else is wrong.
- *Improve your own communication skills* because someone could not understand you because of a language barrier. Try to be an active listener, don't use too complex sentence structures and, in case, ask for clarification.

## Communication within my group

To improve the communication within my group with respect to cultural differences:

- I tried to not interrupt when someone was talking.
- I always asked to repeat a concept if I wasn't sure to get the meaning of a sentence/concept.
- I ignored any prejudices I had about other cultures.
- I tried to listen to the ideas of all the members of the group and to value the positive aspects.
- I've never talked about things I wasn't sure about and I've always asked for clarification to avoid misunderstandings.
